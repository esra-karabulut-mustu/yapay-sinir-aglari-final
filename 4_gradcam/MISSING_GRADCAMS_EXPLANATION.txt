GRAD-CAM TECHNICAL LIMITATION
==============================

ISSUE: MobileNetV2 and EfficientNetB0 Grad-CAM visualizations could not be generated.

ROOT CAUSE: Embedded preprocessing layers in model architecture incompatible with Keras Functional API graph traversal required by Grad-CAM.

ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS:
1. Standard Grad-CAM implementation ✗
2. tf-keras-vis professional library ✗
3. Model reconstruction approach ✗
4. Manual TensorFlow gradient computation ✗

PROPER FIX: Refactor models with external preprocessing (requires retraining, 2-3 hours).

IMPACT: Minimal - all other requirements satisfied, model performance unaffected.

See README.md for detailed technical explanation.
